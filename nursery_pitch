Hi,
I'm with Brough Plants and just calling to see if Wegman's has any particular day of the week set aside for new vendors to come in and show
samples of what they're growing.

1. I most likely won't use much water the first year given relatively low inventory I'm starting with and the types of plants I'm growing.
2. The land next to the greenhouse is an excellent opportunity to expand but I won't take full advantage of that space over the next year
